## Getting Set Up To Work On The DBP Codebase!

This page is here to help you work in the DBP codebase, our project is open source so they sky is your limit!
Starting from working on the DBP or customizing your own version, this is the place to start from.
So if you’d like to help **DBP community** build the coolest devops app, you’re in the right place.

We make changes to DBP by writing patches, testing, revewiging them and pushing them. Here is a small checklist to help you get started:

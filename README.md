## Getting Set Up To Work On The DBP Codebase!

This page is here to help you work in the DBP codebase, our project is open source so the sky is your limit!
Starting from working on the DBP or customizing your own version, this is the place to start from.
So if you’d like to help the **DBP community** build the coolest DevOps app, you’re in the right place.

We make changes to DBP by writing patches, testing, reviewing, and pushing them. Here is a small checklist to help you get started:
